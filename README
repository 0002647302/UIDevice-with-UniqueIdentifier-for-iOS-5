Apple stopped supporting a unique identifier for iOS. This source code solves the problem. It generates a unique identifier based on the mac address of the device in combination with the bundle identifier.

What you need to do:
- copy NSString+MD5Addition and UIDevice+IdentifierAddition to your project.
- use [[UIDevice currentDevice] uniqueIdentifier] to retrieve the unique identifier.
- have fun ;)

//Thanks to Erica Sadun for her UIDevice+Hardware Addition (used for the mac address retrieval).
